## Introduction

This repository showcases different image processing tasks using the OpenCV library. OpenCV is a widely-used open-source computer vision library that provides various tools for working with images and videos.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/opencv-image-processing.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:
   ```
   cd opencv-image-processing
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Explore the various image processing scripts in the repository.
- Modify and experiment with the code to understand how different image processing techniques work.
- Run the scripts using the following command:
  ```
  python script_name.py
  ```

## Examples

1. **Image Filtering**: Learn how to apply various filters (e.g., Gaussian, Median) to enhance or blur images.
2. **Edge Detection**: Detect edges in images using techniques like Canny edge detection.
3. **Color Spaces**: Convert images between different color spaces (e.g., RGB, HSV).
4. **Histogram Analysis**: Analyze image histograms for contrast and brightness adjustments.
5. **Basic Image Manipulations**: Perform basic operations like cropping, resizing, and rotating images.
6. **Object Detection**: Detect and locate objects in images using techniques like template matching.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements, bug fixes, or new image processing techniques to add, feel free to create a pull request. Please ensure that your code follows the established coding style and conventions.
